# YCC Hull / DB

The new system uses the existing Oracle database (hosted at CERN). This is mainly for migration reasons.

To connect to the database (both local and remote) you will need to install [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html).

## Local Instance

You can run a local instance of Oracle XE via Docker - the recommended approach is to use the Docker Compose file in this directory.
